# PANDAS-Challenge

Hello and welcome to my Module 4 PANDA's Project for UCI's Data Analytics Bootcamp. This project introduces my skills of Pandas and my increase use of Jupyter Notebooks!

Within this project I am the new Cheif Data Scientist for a school district. The school baord and the Mayor want to make strategic decisions regarding the future school budgets and priorities. 

My process was the clean and merge the datasets between district data and student data marrying the two into one dataset. From there Analysis was run to validate the total numbers of schools, total number of students, the budget involved, and the average Math and reading schools with their percentages of passing for the entire data set. 
Once validated, anaylsis was run per the school, and a DataFrame was created showcasing the budget per students, average math and reading scores, and percentages passing math, reading, and overall seperated by school and the type of school. 
I then looked at the highest passing and the lowest passing schools to see if there was any correlation to the schools details and why they are preforming the way they were. Also checking grades by year to see if scores got better as the high school experience continued. Then came down to comparing the scores to the per student budget, the school size, and by school type. 

After all the analysis was run, here was the final conclusion: 

Within this dataset we can see measurable success and failures of students based on the evidence provided. 
-Overall, Charter schools have a higher success rate compared to districts, the data seems to suggest this is likly due to smaller class sizes. 
-There is little difference between them when comparing how much money is being used per student; the districts who preformed worse in math and reading scores spend more money per student, whereas the schools that performed best spend less per student. There is not enough data to give a clear indication of why this is outside of class size. 
-Each grade holds their own in math and reading test scores compared to the other years.

Further analysis can conclude that class sizes under 2,500 students with a budget of under $650 per student could expect to see passing rates not only in individual math and reading metrics, but also in overall passing scores.


Thank you!
