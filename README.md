# PANDAS-Challenge

Hello and welcome to my Module 4 PANDA's homework! Within this repo you will see my source code named PyCitySchools_notebook.ipynb in the PyCitySchools folder. My Source CSV's are in the Resources subfolder within PyCitySchools folder. 

All code was created by me using the starter file, class materials, and class AI troubleshooting. Please let me know if you have trouble finding anything. 
Thank you!
